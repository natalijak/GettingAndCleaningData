##Data science coursera Modul#3 "Getting and Cleaning Data""

###This repository stores R-codes associated to the Project requirements on Getting and Cleaning Data.

The Goal which is pursuit within the Modul of Getting and Cleaning Data is to become able to:
1. Collect Data
2. Clean the data
3. Performe Data Analysis on cleaned dataset


###Assignment Requiremnts
1. Create a README.md
2. Submit a tidy data set 
3. Link the script and the txt files to the Github repository
4. Create a CodeBook.md

###Detailed Requirements
Download and unzip the data which is provided on https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Create a R script called run_analysis.R
The script must include codes which cover following requirements:

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
